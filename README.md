# CS-146---Social-Networking-Simulation

The goal here is to attempt a close replication of the layout in networking used by
social media providing the user options to join and leave the network, add friends, display
name and status info, and create/edit profiles. To do so requires the use of an adjacency
list to create a network of vertices and edges, as well as class objects to represent profiles.
Additional code consists of mainly switch/if-else statements to mimic a basic text UI
(user-interface) or menu, and a seperate array was used for objects for proper display of
names and statuses.
